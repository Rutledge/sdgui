As an AI model, I am unable to generate the contents of a `package-lock.json` file because this file is automatically generated by npm. It should not be manually edited or created as it describes the exact tree that was generated when a package was installed, and this includes exact versions and dependencies.

However, you can generally generate this file by running `npm install` in the `ui` directory where your `package.json` file is located. This command should automatically create or update your `package-lock.json`. Please make sure that npm is installed and correctly set up in your environment.

Let me know if you want me to generate any other file.
